# Employee-Tracker-11

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create an efficent way for individuals to view and add informtion regarding employees. This project was built to replace older and more time consuming methods such as pen/paper and excel. This solves the problem of low efficency and I learned more about the link between mysql2 and queries.
